# Security POC (Proof of Concepts)

This repository is dedicated to various security proof of concepts to illustrate specific tests or security queries. It's a compilation of libraries, references, and examples to assist in understanding and demonstrating certain security scenarios. 

> :warning: **Note**: This repo is for demonstration and learning purposes. It does not contain any secrets or sensitive information. 

Each folder generally represents a distinct proof of concept or test scenario.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the desired test or PoC folder.
2. Each folder contains:
   - A brief `README.md` explaining the concept or test.
   - Scripts or configuration files relevant to the test.  These are numbered to show the order in which they get executed.
   - A `99_cleanup.sh` script to revert any configurations or changes made during the demonstration.
